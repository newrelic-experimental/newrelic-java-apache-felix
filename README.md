# Apache Felix Instrumentation

Instrumentation to track calls to the Apache Felix Framework

## Installation

1. Download the Release jars   
2. In the New Relic Java Agent directory (the one containing newrelic.jar), create a directory named extensions   
3. Copy the downloaded jars into the extensions directory   
4. Restart the application

## Getting Started
Once the jars have been deployed, the New Relic Java Agent should start reporting calls to apache-felix under the Database tab.    


## Building

To build the instrumentation jars requires having Gradle installed.   
To Build:   
Set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR to the extensions directory of the New Relic Java Agent or a local directory   
To build a single module, run the command   
./gradlew moduleName:clean moduleName:install   
To build all modules, run the command:   
./gradlew clean install  
If NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR does not point to the extensions directory of the New Relic Java Agent, copy the resulting jars into the extensions directory   
Restart the application

## Support

New Relic hosts and moderates an online forum where customers can interact with New Relic employees as well as other customers to get help and share best practices.
